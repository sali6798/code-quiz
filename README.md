## Description
A general knowledge quiz comprised of 5 questions with 4 options each. A user has 75 seconds to try and answer the questions as fast as they can, with the time left on the clock becoming their score. Each time the user gets a question wrong, 10 seconds is deducted off the timer. When a answer is chosen, a 'Correct!' or 'Wrong!' response is flashed before moving on to the next question. When the quiz is done, the user is able to enter their name and submit their score to the leaderboard. After submission, the leaderboard is displayed and the user's score is highlighted, so it will be easier to see where they stand compared to everyone else. The leaderboard can be viewed at any time from the 'View Leaderboard' link at the top left corner of the screen. The leaderboard page displays a table of rankings, names and scores and a 'Go Back' button and 'Clear Leaderboard' button. The 'Go Back' button returns to the title page where the user can start the quiz again, and the 'Clear Leaderboard' removes all current rankings from the leaderboard. The leaderboard is stored in local storage so it will always be saved and displayed when the user returns to the site, unless they click 'Clear Leaderboard'.
